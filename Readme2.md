Got it! Let's tackle this assignment step by step. We'll go through each part, explain the logic, and build the necessary code. 

### Part 1: Designing a GNN-based model for Node Classification

We'll start with setting up a GNN (Graph Neural Network) using PyTorch Geometric. Our goal is to create a model that can classify nodes in the ogbn-products dataset.

#### Steps:
1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   We'll use the PyTorch Geometric library to load the dataset.
   
2. **Creating the GNN Model**:
   We'll define a Graph Neural Network using Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN).

3. **Training the Model**:
   Train the model on the dataset to perform node classification.

#### Explanation and Code:
First, let's install the necessary libraries:
```python
!pip install torch
!pip install torch-geometric
```

Now, let's load the dataset and define the GNN model:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch_geometric.datasets import OGB
from torch_geometric.data import DataLoader
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

# Load dataset
dataset = OGB(name='ogbn-products')[0]

# Define GNN Model
class GNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(GNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(dataset.num_features, 64)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(64, dataset.num_classes)
        
    def forward(self, data):
        x, edge_index = data.x, data.edge_index
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = F.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return F.log_softmax(x, dim=1)

model = GNN()
print(model)
```
In this code:
- We load the `ogbn-products` dataset using the PyTorch Geometric library.
- We define a GNN model with two graph convolutional layers (`GCNConv`).
- The forward method defines the data flow through the layers.

### Part 2: Loading Dataset and Checking Performance

We need to learn how to load the dataset and check its performance. You can refer to the official documentation for detailed steps. The code snippet below shows how to load the dataset and print the basic information.

```python
data = dataset[0]
print("Number of nodes: ", data.num_nodes)
print("Number of edges: ", data.num_edges)
print("Number of features per node: ", data.num_features)
print("Number of classes: ", dataset.num_classes)
```

### Part 3: Analyzing the Graph and Generating Subgraphs

We'll compute various graph statistics and generate subgraphs as required.

#### Steps:
1. **Compute Diameter, Number of Nodes and Edges, Global Clustering Coefficient**.
2. **Plot the Graph with Labels**.
3. **Generate Node Induced Subgraph**.
4. **Generate Node Embeddings using the 2-hop method**.
5. **Plot the Subgraph and Compute Diameter**.

#### Explanation and Code:

1. **Graph Statistics**:
   We'll use the `NetworkX` library to compute the required statistics.
   
```python
import networkx as nx
from torch_geometric.utils import to_networkx

G = to_networkx(data, to_undirected=True)
diameter = nx.diameter(G)
clustering_coeff = nx.average_clustering(G)
print("Diameter: ", diameter)
print("Global Clustering Coefficient: ", clustering_coeff)
print("Number of Nodes: ", G.number_of_nodes())
print("Number of Edges: ", G.number_of_edges())
```

2. **Plot the Graph**:
   We use `matplotlib` for plotting.
   
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

nx.draw(G, with_labels=True, node_color=data.y.numpy(), cmap=plt.get_cmap('jet'))
plt.show()
```

3. **Generate Node Induced Subgraph**:
   
```python
nodes = list(G.nodes())[:100]  # Taking first 100 nodes for the subgraph
subgraph = G.subgraph(nodes)

# Plot Subgraph
nx.draw(subgraph, with_labels=True, node_color=[subgraph.nodes[n]['y'] for n in subgraph.nodes])
plt.show()

# Compute Diameter
subgraph_diameter = nx.diameter(subgraph)
print("Subgraph Diameter: ", subgraph_diameter)
```

4. **Generate Node Embeddings using 2-hop Method**:

```python
from torch_geometric.nn import Node2Vec

node2vec = Node2Vec(edge_index, embedding_dim=64, walk_length=2, context_size=2, walks_per_node=1)
model = node2vec(torch.arange(data.num_nodes, device=data.edge_index.device))
```

By following these steps, we cover each part of the assignment and explain the logic and reasoning behind the solutions.
